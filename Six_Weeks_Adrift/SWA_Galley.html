				<p>Upon entering the Galley you find nothing but a clean kitchen, minus a handful of dirty dishes in the sink, and a long dining table with various paper laid out upon it.</p>
				<p>Your puzzeled as to why none of your crew are up at this hour.  Maybe they're in their quarters or down in the engine room?</p>
				<p>Looking off to your right along back of the room you see another set of stairs leading down to the engine room.  Just beyond that along the same wall is the door leading to the crew quarters</p>
				<p>And straight to your right is the door to the main deck.</p>
				<p>What would you like to do?</p>
